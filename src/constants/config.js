  {
    question: "Why should I buy a SIM-free iPhone on apple.com?",
    answer: "An unconnected iPhone purchased from apple.com is unlocked. This means you aren’t tied to a single network provider or a multi-year service contract. You can choose the network and tariff that are right for you. Once your new iPhone is activated, it remains unlocked, which means you can use it with any network that provides service for iPhone."
  },
  {
    question: "Is it easy to transfer my data and set up my new iPhone?",
    answer: "Yes, iCloud makes moving your settings, photos, apps and documents to a new device seamless. Just sign in to iCloud when you set up your new device, access your previous device’s iCloud backup and you’ll be ready to go in minutes. Don’t have enough iCloud storage to complete a backup? iCloud will grant you enough temporary storage to make sure you can back up your device and get all of your data transferred, free of charge (iOS 15 required). With Quick Start, you can restore your data and content to your new iPhone from your iCloud backup. For phones using iOS 12.4 or later, Quick Start offers the option of using device-to-device migration, allowing you to transfer all your data wirelessly from your current device to your new one. If you are switching from Android, you need to download the Move to iOS app first and follow the setup process on your new iPhone. To learn how to transfer data to your new iPhone, see support.apple.com/en-gb/HT201269(opens in new window)."

  {
    question: "Will my iPhone work worldwide?",
    answer: "iPhone models currently sold on apple.com work with compatible networks around the world, including 5G and 4G LTE networks. Check with your home network provider regarding international roaming charges, or purchase a compatible nano-SIM at your destination."
  },
  {
    question: "Which network providers offer 5G service?",
    answer: "iPhone 15 Pro, iPhone 15, iPhone 14, iPhone 13 and iPhone SE are 5G capable. For 5G access, you need to activate your iPhone with a network provider that offers 5G service. Some providers may also require a 5G service plan or a new SIM. Contact your provider for more information. Learn more about network providers in your country here(opens in new window)."
